        Coming from a background in customer service, I've always cared about helping people and
        making their experience better. That's what led me to front-end development â€“ where I can
        use code to solve problems and improve the way people interact with technology. I'm still
        early in my journey, but I'm excited to keep learning and building tools that make things
        simpler, smoother, and more enjoyable.
