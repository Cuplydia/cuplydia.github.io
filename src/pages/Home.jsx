          Coming from a background in customer service, I've always cared about helping people and
          making their experience better. That's what led me to front-end development â€“ where I can
          use code to solve problems and improve the way people interact with technology. I'm still
          early in my journey, but I'm excited to keep learning and building tools that make things
          simpler, smoother, and more enjoyable.
